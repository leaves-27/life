Welcome to the final day of the crash course!

We've got a very special final installment for you, but first, let's review answers to yesterday's quiz.
(Hopefully a freebie) Pick one: better data or fancier algorithms.
​Better data!
When should you split your dataset into training and test sets, and why?
​You should split your dataset before you begin modeling, and you shouldn't touch your test set until you're ready to pick a final model.
This allows you to have a truly unseen dataset at the end, which will give you a reliable estimate of model performance.
What's the key difference between model parameters and hyperparameters?
​Model parameters can be learned directly from the data (i.e. regression coefficients).
Hyperparameters must be set before training a model (i.e. penalty strength).
Explain how cross-validation helps you "tune" your models?
​Cross-validation allows you to use only your training set to evaluate how an algorithm performs using different sets of hyperparameter values.
You can use the cross-validated scores (on the hold-out folds) to pick the best set of hyperparameter values.


Nice job following along so far... we've really cover a lot of ground over the last week.
On day 1, you saw a bird's-eye view of the entire machine learning workflow.
Then, on day 2, you learned our framework for fast, efficient, and decisive exploratory analysis.
Day 3 was all about data cleaning, which is perhaps the most important step of all.
Next, on day 4, we shared our favorite heuristics for feature engineering.
On day 5, we discussed regularization and ensembles, and you learned about 5 algorithms that leverage those mechanisms.
And yesterday, we walked through a proven formula for training excellent models after the other steps have been completed correctly.
Today, we'll give you our best recommendations for where to go from here, including how to transform these concepts into valuable practical skills that can significantly impact your career.

 
1. You have two options...

From here, you have two options.

1.) The first is to go at it alone, and begin applying these skills to projects that interest you.
The step-by-step blueprint you've learned will give you a huge head-start.
Strike while the iron is hot! Pick a topic, find a dataset, and start practicing.
For tools, we strongly recommend the Python stack, including the following libraries:
NumPy for efficient numerical computations.
Pandas for data management.
Scikit-Learn for algorithms and model training.
Seaborn for easy/common visualizations.
Matplotlib to customize visualizations.
After you've mastered the core workflow, you can use the rest of this lesson as guideposts for continued study.
Our #1 tip for self-study is to skip the textbooks and jump into projects ASAP. It's much faster to learn in context, i.e. "learning by doing." Plus, it will be easier to stay motivated and continue progressing.

2.) The second option is to allow us to provide over-the-shoulder mentorship.
We've carefully designed a Machine Learning Masterclass with 4 epic, portfolio-ready projects.
You will not only master this core workflow, but also more advanced skills as well.
Hundreds of other happy students have been through the course, and the satisfaction rate is incredible.

Of course, you may be wondering, if we've already given you the complete blueprint, what's there left to cover in the masterclass?

Well, quite simply, there's a lot that we couldn't squeeze into these 7 days...


2. Learn how to code and implement each step

The first one is obvious. We couldn't include source code in this crash course because everyone comes from different experience levels.

However, thanks to our comprehensive Python Crash Course, you'll learn all of the programming skills needed for machine learning, even if you've never programmed before.

Then, you'll develop hard-core practical skills and confidence as you progress through 4 guided projects and 16 Companion Workbooks, broken into logical modules.
Image

Of course, you'll have plenty of Exercises along the way to solidify your skills. The learning curve is carefully planned so that you'll be challenged, but not frustrated.
Image

Oh yeah, and even if you get stuck, each module has a detailed Answer Key with literally every line of source code.

 
3. Take your projects to the next level

So far, we've covered the 5 core steps of applied machine learning.

However, there are also several important situational steps. When you master these steps, you'll open many more possibilities.
For example, some of the most interesting applications require you to creatively restructure the data first (Data Wrangling).
In addition, correctly Pre-Processing your features (transformations, standardization, etc.) will boost your performance significantly.
You'll also get practical tips for Project Delivery, such as how to package your model into a script that can be called from a command line or run on the cloud.
And much more...
The 5 core steps glue everything together, and these situational steps will take your projects to the next level.

 
4. Gain more clarity with essential theory

Right from Project 1, you'll learn about Model Complexity, which is what we consider to be the "heart" of machine learning. 
And that's no exaggeration...
This is perhaps the single most important concept that couldn't fit into this email course...
...because it's best taught alongside illustrative code examples.
This one vital concept will provide you absolute clarity about the big picture of machine learning.
Image

In addition, you'll find gentle, practical explanations of other essential concepts, including:
Mapping functions as a surprisingly effective learning tool.
Causes of overfitting and how to deal with it in diverse situations.
Cost functions and how they tie into important mechanisms such as regularization.
Classification algorithms and their key differences from their regression counterparts.
Clustering algorithms and the additional step you should take before training them.
And much more...
Image
Everything is illustrated with code, examples, and visualizations.

 
5. Train your decision-making

As you may have noticed, applied machine learning requires dozens of decisions for each step (i.e. a skilled chef).
When have you done enough exploratory analysis?
How can you spot potential fixes you'll need to make?
Do your visualizations suggest good features to engineer?
What are the most impactful hyperparameters to tune?
When should you pre-process your features?
Which steps should go inside the cross-validation loop?
Which performance metrics should you use?
And so on...
Image
In the masterclass, you'll learn simple approaches for tackling these decisions, and you'll get plenty of practice making them.

 
6. Develop advanced skills

To train professional-grade machine learning models in the shortest time possible, you'll need to master a few additional advanced skills.

Our masterclass will teach each of these skills, including:
How to fit multi-step Pre-Processing Pipelines into cross-validation loops to ensure robust results.
How to deal with the Curse of Dimensionality.
How to implement Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and how to interpret your components.
How to deal with Unbalanced Classes.
How to use Probability Thresholds and ROC Curves to improve your classification models.
How to perform Multi-Layer Groupbys for data wrangling.
How to make Advanced Visualizations for presentations and reports.
And much more...
Image
Best of all, you'll learn each of these important skills in context, which makes them easier understand, retain, and place into the big picture.

 
7. Most importantly... practice, practice, practice

Yes, we talkin' bout practice.

And that wraps up the 7-Day Machine Learning Crash Course!

By the way, even if you decide not to join the masterclass, you can use the list above as guideposts for further studying. You've learned the core blueprint, so you now have a very strong foundation to go forward.

The masterclass is meant for those who want over-the-shoulder mentorship and accelerated learning. If that sounds like something you'd be interested in, you can learn more about it here:
